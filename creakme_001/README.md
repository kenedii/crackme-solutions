# creakme_001 by disip

My keygen built in MASM32 x86 Assembly for creakme_001 by disip.

Note: Username must be (3 >= letters <=5)

The GetDlgItemTextA call reads in up to 256 bytes, but there is only space in memory for 10 password characters, so only 5 username characters. (shoutout to [coffeemike's solution](https://crackmes.one/static/solution/5ab950c333c5d422feed8a81.zip) for this detail)
